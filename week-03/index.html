As an individual with a deep passion for both design and technology, I have always been drawn to the intersection of these two fields. In my pursuit of self-expression and creativity, <span class="schoolName"> Hunter College </span> I have taken part in various programs and initiatives that allowed me to explore the limitless possibilities that graphic design and computer science can offer.
					<br>
					My current academic pursuit involves a major in emerging media, where I am honing my skills and knowledge to produce innovative and inclusive media content. My long-term goal is to create media that not only entertains but also raises awareness on significant social concerns such as gentrification, homelessness, and food poverty. Through my work, I aim to inspire people to think critically and become more socially aware, ultimately leading to positive change in our society.
					<br>
					In essence, I am driven by my passion for design and technology, and I strive to make a meaningful impact on the world through my creative work. With my growing expertise and vision, I am confident that I can make a significant difference in the lives of those around me and contribute to a brighter, more equitable future.
