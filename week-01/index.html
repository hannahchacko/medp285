	<h3 style=" color:lavenderblush;"> Biography</h3>



	<p style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow;"> Welcome to my page! A bit about myself- I consider myself a <b> creative </b>, but outside of school and work, I love taking <b> meditative walks </b> near a pier or around my neighborhood in Ridgewood Queens. A few of my interests that I've always had are <b>jazz </b>(any type), <b>frozen yogurt</b>, and <b>learning languages </b>(I still don't know many.) 
I like to be a part of <b>community orientated spaces</b>, and spaces that challenge how things can be made easier and accessible for those within the community. This interest is pushes forward my career in UX Design, or any other field that has the common denominator of <b>usability</b>.

	<h3 style="color: lavenderblush;"> Artist Statement</h3>

	<p style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow  ;"> <em> As an individual with a deep passion for both design and technology, I have always been drawn to the intersection of these two fields. In my pursuit of self-expression and creativity, I have taken part in various programs and initiatives that allowed me to explore the limitless possibilities that graphic design and computer science can offer. </em>
<br>
<br>
<em>My current academic pursuit involves a major in emerging media, where I am honing my skills and knowledge to produce innovative and inclusive media content. My long-term goal is to create media that not only entertains but also raises awareness on significant social concerns such as gentrification, homelessness, and food poverty. Through my work, I aim to inspire people to think critically and become more socially aware, ultimately leading to positive change in our society.</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>In essence, I am driven by my passion for design and technology, and I strive to make a meaningful impact on the world through my creative work. With my growing expertise and vision, I am confident that I can make a significant difference in the lives of those around me and contribute to a brighter, more equitable future. </em> </p>
